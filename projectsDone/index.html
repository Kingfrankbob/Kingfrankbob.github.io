          <p style="text-align: right;">
            This project is an interesting one. It contains the algorithm<br>
            to draw and sort out all the numbers in a mandelbrot set. It colors<br>
            it based off of the current number being used. It was written in C++<br>
            and is ran through Microsoft Visual Studio.</p>

            <h3>Hilbert Curve With Graphics: </h3>
            <p>This project was based for my Random Quote Matrix. It takes the recursive
              algorithm use in a Hilbert curve and using the Graphic.h library draws it
              up. It also will ask if you want the coordinates stored on a separate text
              file incase you want to draw something without the algorithms. This is
              another C++ project again ran through Visual Studio.</p>

            <p>This is a mod developed for Mindustry, a game by Anuke. The game in a brief
              description is a tower defense based game, you mine resources and research technology
              to build turrets, collect more resources and capture the Planet. The mod created is
              suppose to add more support units, and help with supporting other units and the base.</p>

              information. I do not plan to change it once I have fully completed it. Occasionally my
              interests will change so I may do it then. I did find a template to help with designing the
              website, but a lot of the style is done by me.</p>

          <p style="text-align: right;">
            This was the Christmas Advent of 2022. All the challenges that I did are listed on the repo<br>
            along with more information. It was a fun challenge, and really tested some of my c# coding<br>
            skills. My favorite was trying to implement a Dijkstra Path-Finding Algorithm </p>

            <p>This was the first game that I decided to build. It was in the console because thats all I
              knew how to do at the time. It is really simple, and anyone that knows a bit about programming
              could understand it. It uses momentum, 2 paddle objects, a canvas and a ball. I did add a bot
              later after I was satisfied and that was fun to make.</p>

            <p>This one is kinda self-explanatory. This is a collection of the challenges given to me and my
              colleague while we took the C# courses from Udemy. This has helped, and served as a refrence
              for some interesting functions, and generally to help me out!</p>

            <p>If im being totally honest, I don't know if I will ever finish this one. It is a racing game built
              into the console as well! One of the few of its kind! It is pretty simple, and just colors the console
              for all the object tracking. It does have a custom track converter once you design it! There are a
              few difficulties to try, and is pretty hard sometimes!</p>

            <p>It needs some sprites, but it is almost finished with everything. It adds some more materials, along with
              a few new turrets
              to make it js a bit easier to global strike some enemies. It was fun but challenging when I tried to come
              back to programming
              after doing so much in c#. </p>

            <p>For this project I was bored and wanted something to do. I spent a slight amount of time
              working on this project. It was really enjoyable and I had some fun putting my own little
              secrets inside the application. It is a simple note taking application that allows you to
              take notes for fun, and will give you a files explorer as well.

              some peers, so I cannot take full credit.

              accordingly. It should be easy to read and usable if someone needs to look at it. The repo is
              called algorithms and has the two folders containing the project for each of them. Done in winforms.

            <p>The original inspiration for this project was my original Random Quote Board, this one is meant for
              a 64x64 Matrix that I got off of Adafruit. It has caused a whole bunch of challenges because of the
              different style of compiling, but it has been fun to try to do! I still need to add some features for
              implementing full screen collision matrixes. I will no longer be working this as its not something
              I see fit using in the future...

              So when I made this one, I figured it would suffice
