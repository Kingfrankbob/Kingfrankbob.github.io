          <h1>Upcoming Ideas:</h1>
          <h2>New Ones:</h2>
          <p>Ones that I have made notes to do in the future!</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Tower Defense Game:</h3>
          <p>Make a tower defense game with a custom map editor and a custom game engine. It does not have to be <br>
            something super scientific, but enough to be playable. I have always had a fond love for these kinds<br>
            of things, the resource management and my main inspiration for this would be Bloons Tower Defense 6.<br>
            Still thinking about this but will probs not happen...</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>WWW.poolcontroller.com:</h3>
          <p>Fully automated global access to the pool controller through some protection would be fun<br>
            I would make sure that if we are on vacation or away when we come back we can turn it on and heat up the
            pool</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Mandelbrot set with double precision:</h3>
          <p>Its pretty annoying to make a mandelbrot set without a decent zoom for me, I just havent figured<br>
            it out even with ai... Ill get it done eventually.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Recurring Ones:</h2>
          <p>There are some projects that I do every year!</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Advent of Code:</h3>
          <p>Every year I do the Advent of Code, it is a 25 day challenge where you have to solve a puzzle. <br>
            The puzzles get harder and harder as the days go on. I have done it every year since 2021, and I <br>
            have only missed but a few days. I have done it with a few friends, and I have done it alone. It is a fun
            <br>
            challenge that I look forward to every year. I have done it in C#, and once in C++.<br><br>
